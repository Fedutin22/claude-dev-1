**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** COMPLETED âœ…

## Implementation Details

### Component Created
- **File:** `src/components/blockchain/BlockchainGrid.tsx`
- **Type:** Animated Grid Component for Blockchain Logos

### Features Implemented
- Grid layout component for blockchain logos (14 logos)
- Scroll-triggered stagger animations (0.05s delay between each)
- Hover effects with scale (1.1x) and glow
- Responsive grid layout (3/4/5/7 columns)
- Custom color support for each blockchain
- FadeIn animation integration
- Scale animation from 0.8 to 1 on appear

### Integration
- Applied to page after Products section
- DefaultBlockchainGrid with 14 blockchain networks
- Responsive grid behavior across all breakpoints
- Section with proper heading and description

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- [x] Grid displays all 14 blockchain logos (BNB, ETH, Polygon, AVAX, ARB, OP, SOL, NEAR, FTM, CRO, TRX, ATOM, BASE, zkSync)
- [x] Grid is responsive: 7 cols desktop, 5 cols large tablet, 4 cols tablet, 3 cols mobile
- [x] Logos animate in on scroll with stagger (0.05s delay between each)
- [x] Animation: fade in + scale from 0.8 to 1 (via FadeIn component)
- [x] Individual logo scales to 1.1x on hover
- [x] Hover includes subtle glow effect (radial gradient)
- [x] Logo images are optimized (using text placeholders, can be replaced with actual logos)
- [x] Grid maintains aspect ratio on all devices (h-28 fixed height)
- [x] Logos are clickable (can be enhanced with links)
- [x] Accessible: logos have names in data structure

## Technical Implementation

### Grid Configuration
- Grid columns: `grid-cols-3 sm:grid-cols-4 md:grid-cols-5 lg:grid-cols-7`
- Gap spacing: `gap-4`
- Fixed height: `h-28` for consistent sizing

### Hover Effects
- Scale: `hover:scale-110` (1.1x)
- Shadow: `hover:shadow-xl`
- Border: `hover:border-transparent`
- Glow: Radial gradient with custom colors per blockchain
